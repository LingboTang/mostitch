== Mostitch ==

Mostitch is Marsyas Ostitch. 

Ostitch was an audio collager. An audio collager takes input source
audio and produces output source audio which is composed of chunks of
the input. The output is usually is meant to mimic another signal
(like a song or speech).

== Motivation ==

While I do enjoy OCaml, I also enjoy very fast turn around on musical
ideas, as well as I do not enjoy rewriting code. Marsyas is very slick
and full of great code not found in CSound and other applications I
like to use.

== TODO ==

* [ ] Expose the index addPoint to the pyflann implementation so we can dynamically add points on
      the fly
* [ ] Granular Synthesis
* [ ] Windowing Samples
* [ ] Larger input samples than output samples

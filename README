== Mostitch ==

Mostitch is Marsyas Ostitch. 

Ostitch was an audio collager. An audio collager takes input source
audio and produces output source audio which is composed of chunks of
the input. The output is usually is meant to mimic another signal
(like a song or speech).

Mostitch is the Marsyas port of Ostitch.

This version seeks

== Motivation ==

While I do enjoy OCaml, I also enjoy very fast turn around on musical
ideas, as well as I do not enjoy rewriting code. Marsyas is very slick
and full of great code not found in CSound and other applications I
like to use.

== Requirements ==

Get Marsyas http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/ and install the python bindings.

Get pyflann http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN install flann
 and install the python bindings. https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann git://github.com/mariusmuja/flann.git

== TODO ==

* [X] Expose the index addPoint to the pyflann implementation so we can dynamically add points on
      the fly
* [X] Granular Synthesis
* [X] Windowing Samples
* [ ] Change Pitch/rate of sample playback
* [ ] Larger input samples than output samples
